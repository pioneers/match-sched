#TODO

##Essential

- ~~Elimination matches~~
- ~~Challonge bracket tab~~
    + ~~Fix Challonge bracket tab to include "not available" message~~
- ~~Incorporate Anthony's current team web app~~
- Collapsible sidebar where applicable (for UI consistency)
- Clear button for team selection buttons
- ~~**Indication of current match**~~
- ~~**Add Twitch stream**~~
- **Fix code so that match table is ALWAYS centered**

##Nice to have
- ~~GET TEAM HIGHLIGHTING TO WORK~~
- Loading spinner/message?
- Warning in case of mobile screen?
- Better colors :<<<
- ~~Error/unavailable message~~
- ~~Sticky table header~~
- Team stats as `iframe` instead of external link - don't think this is possible though
